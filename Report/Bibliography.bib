  abstract = {Nanopore analysis of nucleic acid is now routine, but detection of proteins remains challenging. Here, we report the systematic characterization of the effect of macromolecular crowding on the detection sensitivity of a solid-state nanopore for circular and linearized DNA plasmids, globular proteins ({$\beta$}-galactosidase), and filamentous proteins ({$\alpha$}-synuclein amyloid fibrils). We observe a remarkable ca. 1000-fold increase in the molecule count for the globular protein {$\beta$}-galactosidase and a 6-fold increase in peak amplitude for plasmid DNA under crowded conditions. We also demonstrate that macromolecular crowding facilitates the study of the topology of DNA plasmids and the characterization of amyloid fibril preparations with different length distributions. A remarkable feature of this method is its ease of use; it simply requires the addition of a macromolecular crowding agent to the electrolyte. We therefore envision that macromolecular crowding can be applied to many applications in the analysis of biomolecules by solid-state nanopores.},

  abstract = {Nanopore systems have emerged as a leading platform for the analysis of biomolecular complexes with single-molecule resolution. The conformation of biomolecules, such as RNA, is highly dependent on the electrolyte composition, but solid-state nanopore systems often require high salt concentration to operate, precluding analysis of macromolecular conformations under physiologically relevant conditions. Here, we report the implementation of a polymer\textendash electrolyte solid-state nanopore system based on alkali metal halide salts dissolved in 50\% w/v poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) to augment the performance of our system. We show that polymer\textendash electrolyte bath governs the translocation dynamics of the analyte which correlates with the physical properties of the salt used in the bath. This allowed us to identify CsBr as the optimal salt to complement PEG to generate the largest signal enhancement. Harnessing the effects of the polymer\textendash electrolyte, we probed the conformations of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) RNA genome fragments under physiologically relevant conditions. Our system was able to fingerprint CHIKV RNA fragments ranging from {$\sim$}300 to {$\sim$}2000 nt length and subsequently distinguish conformations between the co-transcriptionally folded and the natively refolded {$\sim$}2000 nt CHIKV RNA. We envision that the polymer\textendash electrolyte solid-state nanopore system will further enable structural and conformational analyses of individual biomolecules under physiologically relevant conditions.},

These effects are often not easy to see on the oscilloscope screen as an experiment proceeds (especially since it is common practice for the signal to be rather heavily filtered for observation during the experiment).

  abstract = {Nanopore sensors provide an innovative platform for rapid and label-free biomolecule detection. The analytical information extracted from resistive pulse sensing (RPS) measurement, though powerful has several limitations. To address these challenges, various signal conditioning algorithms have been researched which include efficient clustering and classification of data, applying probabilistic models to reduce information overlap and also leveraging transient analysis of ionic current instead of the steady state RPS measurement. Additionally, as the current is typically in few picoampere regime with high transition rates, its faithful measurement requires precision instrumentation like a patch clamp amplifier with low noise and high bandwidth. However, for practical deployment of such systems, it is necessary to develop portable electronic interface. Significant efforts have been directed globally to develop on-chip customized integrated circuits with low noise, high bandwidth amplifiers. Thus, it is absolutely timely and pertinent to conduct a review on the various signal processing schemes and electronic interfaces for single biomolecule identification using nanopores which will enable to comprehend the current status for its deployment as a commercial platform for genomics and ultrasensitive detection. To the best of our knowledge, the data extraction methodologies and electronic interface schemes for nanopores have not yet been summarized. In this paper, a comprehensive review emphasizing the signal processing algorithms for DNA sequencing and protein identification in complex analyte using functionalized and non-functionalized nanopores has been presented along with the on-chip low noise electronic interfaces required for field deployable measurement.},

We developed Modular Single-Molecule Analysis Interface (MOSAIC), an open source analysis software that improves the accuracy and throughput of nanopore-based measurements. Two key algorithms are implemented: ADEPT, which uses a physical model of the nanopore system to characterize short-lived events that do not reach their steady-state current, and CUSUM+, a version of the cumulative sum statistical method optimized for longer events that do. We show that ADEPT detects previously unreported conductance states that occur as double-stranded DNA translocates through a 2.4 nm solid-state nanopore and reveals new interactions between short single-stranded DNA and the vestibule of a biological pore. These findings demonstrate the utility of MOSAIC and the ADEPT algorithm, and offer a new tool that can improve the analysis of nanopore-based measurements.},

Red-green confusion people do not confuse all kinds of red and all kinds of green. By selecting particular hues for each color, the ability to distinguish between the four colors should be greatly improved. Our study thus concluded that, by carefully selecting hues within the range of each color category, it is possible to establish color-combinations which are easily distinguishable to people of all color-vision types in order to facilitate visual communication.},

The performance of the DRRM switch is then studied and compared with the iSLIP switch. The delay performance under uniform traffic and the hot-spot throughput of DRRM is better than that of iSLIP, while the throughput of iSLIP under some nonuniform traffic scenarios is slightly higher than that of DRRM. Since throughput drops below 100\%, under nonuniform traffic, we also examine some variations of the DRRM matching scheme for nonuniform traffic.},

Non-linear energy operator (NEO), is a popular spike detector due to its detection accuracy and its hardware friendly architecture. However, it involves a thresholding stage, whose value is usually approximated and is thus not optimal. This approximation deteriorates the performance in real-time systems where signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimation is a challenge, especially at lower SNRs. In this paper, we propose an automatic and robust threshold calculation method using an empirical gradient technique. The method is tested on two different datasets. The results show that our optimized threshold improves the detection accuracy in both high SNR and low SNR signals. Boxplots are presented that provide a statistical analysis of improvements in accuracy, for instance, the 75th percentile was at 98.7\% and 93.5\% for the optimized NEO threshold and traditional NEO threshold, respectively.},

  abstract = {This tutorial review will introduce and explore the fundamental aspects of nanopore (bio)sensing, fabrication, modification, and the emerging technologies and applications that both intrigue and inspire those working in and around the field. Although nanopores can be classified into two categories, solid-state and biological, they are essentially two sides of the same coin. For instance, both garner popularity due to their ability to confine analytes of interest to a nanoscale volume. Due to the vast diversity of nanopore platforms and applications, no single review can cover the entire landscape of published work in the field. Therefore, in this article focus will be placed on recent advancements and developments taking place in the field of solid-state nanopores. It should be stated that the intention of this tutorial review is not to cite all articles relating to solid-state nanopores, but rather to highlight recent, select developments that will hopefully benefit the new and seasoned scientist alike. Initially we begin with the fundamentals of solid-state nanopore sensing. Then the spotlight is shone on the sophisticated fabrication methods that have their origins in the semiconductor industry. One inherent advantage of solid-state nanopores is in the ease of functionalizing the surface with a range of molecules carrying functional groups. Therefore, an entire section is devoted to highlighting various chemical and bio-molecular modifications and explores how these permit the development of novel sensors with specific targets and functions. The review is completed with a discussion on novel detection strategies using nanopores. Although the most popular mode of nanopore sensing is based upon what has come to be known as ionic-current blockade sensing, there is a vast, growing literature based around exploring alternative detection techniques to further expand on the versatility of the sensors. Such techniques include optical, electronic, and force based methods. It is perhaps fair to say that these new frontiers have caused further excitement within the sensing community.},

This instantaneous nature of NEO and its very low computational burden make it an ideal tool for spike detection. The efficacy of the proposed method has been tested with simulated signals as well as with real electroencephalograms (EEGs).},

Measurement of SpO2 relies on comparing the relative absorption of light in the red and infrared regions with the expected absorption pattern of oxygenated and deoxygenation adult hemoglobin. As this screening tool has entered common clinical use, test limitations have emerged, including concern about the risk of overestimation of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry in a disproportionate number of people with dark skin pigment, leading to potential for underdiagnosis of true hypoxemia. In addition, a range of challenges may arise in patients with increased levels of methemoglobin \textendash{} whether acquired or inherited \textendash{} carboxyhemoglobin, or in patients with a subset of inherited variant hemoglobins.

  abstract = {Nanopores have become important tools for single molecule experiments, where information about the properties of DNA/RNA or proteins is inferred from current pulses elicited by individual molecules as they traverse a single pore. However, because of necessary electronic filters employed in the measurement technique, the extraction of meaningful information from short pulses is limited. This restricts the use of nanopores for the investigation of small molecules which cross the pore rapidly. Here we present a method which significantly improves the accuracy of the analysis of noise-filtered current pulses. We introduce improved criteria to measure the pulse width and propose a method to evaluate the pulse height from the falling edge of the pulse, which renders the identification of a pulse plateau unnecessary. The new methods are compared to conventional routines and validated by analyzing representative current pulses as well as experimental protein translocation data. It is demonstrated that the pulse properties can be recovered with satisfying accuracy beyond the usual limitations of Bessel filters, i.e., from pulses featuring a width of merely 0.3fc-1 (fc being the filter cutoff frequency).},

We discuss methods for the detection of the local baseline and propose a new detection algorithm that bypasses some of the classical weaknesses of moving-average detection. Our new approach removes detected events and re-creates an ideal event-free baseline subsequently used to recalculate the local baseline. Iterative operation of this algorithm causes both the moving average of the baseline current and its standard deviation to converge to their correct values. We explain different approaches to selecting events and building event populations, and we show the value of keeping track of the changes in parameters, such as the event rate and the pore resistance, throughout the course of the experiment.

This algorithm is an abrupt change detection algorithm that provides fitting of current blockages, allowing the user to easily identify the different levels in each event. Our method detects events using adaptive thresholds that adapt to low-frequency variations in the baseline. After event identification, our method uses the CUSUM algorithm to fit the levels inside every event and automatically extracts their time and amplitude information. This facilitates the statistical analysis of an event population with a given number of levels. The obtained information improves the interpretation of interactions between the molecule and nanopore. Since our program does not require any prior information about the analyzed molecules, novel molecule\textendash nanopore interactions can be characterized. In addition our program is very fast and stable.

Despite the spectral spread of the pulse-like signals that characterize these recordings when a sinusoidal basis is employed, Bessel filters are commonly used to denoise these signals to acceptable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the cost of losing many of the faster temporal features. Here, we report improvements to the SNR that can be achieved using wavelet denoising instead of Bessel filtering. When combined with state-of-the-art high-bandwidth CMOS recording instrumentation, we can reduce baseline noise levels by over a factor of 4 compared to a 2.5 MHz Bessel filter while retaining transient properties in the signal comparable to this filter bandwidth. Similarly, for ion-channel recordings, we achieve a temporal response better than a 100 kHz Bessel filter with a noise level comparable to that achievable with a 25 kHz Bessel filter. Improvements in SNR can be used to achieve robust statistical analyses of these recordings, which may provide important insights into nanopore translocation dynamics and mechanisms of ion-channel function.},

There have been concerns regarding potential bias in pulse oximetry measurements for people with dark skin. We aimed to assess the effects of skin pigmentation on the accuracy of oxygen saturation measurement by pulse oximetry (SpO               2               ) compared with the gold standard SaO               2               measured by CO-oximetry.                                                Methods                            We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus (up to December 2021), as well as               ClinicalTrials.gov               and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to August 2021). We identified studies comparing SpO               2               values in any population, in any care setting, using any type of pulse oximeter, with SaO               2               by standard CO-oximetry; and measuring the impact of skin pigmentation or ethnicity on pulse oximetry accuracy. We performed meta-analyses for mean bias (the primary outcome in this review) and its standard deviations (SDs) across studies included for each subgroup of level of skin pigmentation and ethnicity. We calculated accuracy root-mean-square (               A                                rms                              ) and 95\% limits of agreement based on pooled mean bias and pooled SDs for each subgroup.                                                Results                            We included 32 studies (6505 participants); 27/32 (84.38\%) in hospitals and none in people's homes. Findings of 14/32 studies (43.75\%) were judged, via QUADAS-2, at high overall risk of bias. Fifteen studies measured skin pigmentation and 22 referred only to ethnicity. Compared with standard SaO               2               measurement, pulse oximetry probably overestimates oxygen saturation in people with dark skin (pooled mean bias 1.11\%; 95\% confidence interval 0.29\% to 1.93\%) and people described as Black/African American (pooled mean bias 1.52\%; 0.95\% to 2.09\%) (moderate- and low-certainty evidence). These results suggest that, for people with dark skin, pulse oximetry may overestimate blood oxygen saturation by around 1\% on average compared with SaO               2               . The bias of pulse oximetry measurements for people with other levels of skin pigmentation, or those from the White/Caucasian group is more uncertain. The data do not suggest overestimation in people from other ethnic groups such as those described as Asian, Hispanic, or mixed ethnicity (pooled mean bias 0.31\%, 0.09\% to 0.54\%), but this evidence is low certainty. Whilst the extent of mean bias is small or negligible for all the subgroups of population evaluated, the associated imprecision is unacceptably large (with the pooled SDs {$>$} 1\%). Nevertheless, when the extents of measurement bias and precision are considered jointly in               A                                rms                              , pulse oximetry measurements for all the subgroups appear acceptably accurate (with               A                                rms                              {$<$} 4\%).                                                Conclusions                            Low-certainty evidence suggests that pulse oximetry may overestimate oxygen saturation in people with dark skin and people whose ethnicity is reported as Black/African American, compared with SaO               2               , although the overestimation may be quite small in hospital settings. The clinical importance of any overestimation will depend on the particular clinical circumstance. Pulse oximetry measurements appear accurate but imprecise for all levels of skin pigmentation. The evidence relates to clinician-measured oximetry in health care environments and may not be reflected in home pulse oximetry where other factors may also influence accuracy.                                                Author summary                            Why was this study done?                                                   Pulse oximetry was widely used in hospital and at home to measure blood oxygen levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                     There was uncertainty as to whether skin pigmentation affects the accuracy of pulse oximetry measurements.

We assessed, via systematic review, the effects of skin pigmentation on the accuracy of pulse oximetry measurement (SpO                     2                     ) compared with SaO                     2                     measured by standard CO-oximetry.                                                                                             In people with dark skin, oxygen saturation measured in hospital by pulse oximetry may be overestimated by an average of 1\% compared with gold standard SaO                     2                     , however, the evidence is of low certainty.                                                                                             The accuracy of pulse oximetry measured compared with standard SaO                     2                     is quite uncertain for people with light or medium levels of skin pigmentation and for people from ethnic groups other than those described in papers as Black or African American.

Hospital measured pulse oximetry may overestimate oxygen saturation in people with dark skin compared with SaO                     2                     by approximately 1\%.                                                                                             The implications of this finding in different clinical scenarios will vary but could be clinically important. Impacts are likely to be at the thresholds of being diagnosed as having hypoxaemia where even a small SpO                     2                     overestimation could lead to clinically important hypoxaemia remaining undetected and untreated.                                                                        How these findings extrapolate to community and home care settings is unclear.},

  abstract = {Proteins are structurally dynamic macromolecules, and it is challenging to quantify the conformational properties of their native state in solution. Nanopores can be efficient tools to study proteins in a solution environment. In this method, an electric field induces electrophoretic and/or electro-osmotic transport of protein molecules through a nanopore slightly larger than the protein molecule. High-bandwidth ion current measurement is used to detect the transit of each protein molecule. First, our measurements reveal a correlation between the mean current blockade amplitude and the radius of gyration for each protein. Next, we find a correlation between the shape of the current signal amplitude distributions and the protein fluctuation as obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Further, the magnitude of the structural fluctuations, as probed by experiments and simulations, correlates with the ratio of {$\alpha$}-helix to {$\beta$}-sheet content. We highlight the resolution of our measurements by resolving two states of calmodulin, a canonical protein that undergoes a conformational change in response to calcium binding.},

  abstract = {To achieve fast and accurate analysis of weak current signal of nanopore-based single molecule detection, an online data process based on adaptive threshold algorithm with data buffering technique and finite impulse response filtering was designed. A software system based on the data process was developed for online recognition and analysis of nanopore events during nanopore experiment. To testify the performance of the algorithm and software system, ideal signals with different noise level (20\textendash 100 pA) were generated at bandwidth ranging from 3 kHz to 100 kHz. The result showed that this software system was stable at different bandwidths and sampling rates and could be used in analyzing the signals at high noise. The proposed software system was further applied to aerolysin nanopore experiment for detection of poly(dA)4 molecules. The results showed that the data process system could be applied in real nanopore recording experiment with high accuracy and speed.},

  abstract = {Nanopore technology has been extensively investigated for analysis of biomolecules, and a success story in this field concerns DNA sequencing using a nanopore chip featuring an array of hundreds of biological nanopores (BioNs). Solid-state nanopores (SSNs) have been explored to attain longer lifetime and higher integration density than what BioNs can offer, but SSNs are generally considered to generate higher noise whose origin remains to be confirmed. Here, we systematically study low-frequency (including thermal and flicker) noise characteristics of SSNs measuring 7 to 200 nm in diameter drilled through a 20-nm-thick SiNx membrane by focused ion milling. Both bulk and surface ionic currents in the nanopore are found to contribute to the flicker noise, with their respective contributions determined by salt concentration and pH in electrolytes as well as bias conditions. Increasing salt concentration at constant pH and voltage bias leads to increase in the bulk ionic current and noise therefrom. Changing pH at constant salt concentration and current bias results in variation of surface charge density, and hence alteration of surface ionic current and noise. In addition, the noise from Ag/AgCl electrodes can become predominant when the pore size is large and/or the salt concentration is high. Analysis of our comprehensive experimental results leads to the establishment of a generalized nanopore noise model. The model not only gives an excellent account of the experimental observations, but can also be used for evaluation of various noise components in much smaller nanopores currently not experimentally available.},

  abstract = {Nanopore technology holds great promise for a wide range of applications such as biomedical sensing, chemical detection, desalination, and energy conversion. For sensing performed in electrolytes in particular, abundant information about the translocating analytes is hidden in the fluctuating monitoring ionic current contributed from interactions between the analytes and the nanopore. Such ionic currents are inevitably affected by noise; hence, signal processing is an inseparable component of sensing in order to identify the hidden features in the signals and to analyze them. This Guide starts from untangling the signal processing flow and categorizing the various algorithms developed to extracting the useful information. By sorting the algorithms under Machine Learning (ML)-based versus non-ML-based, their underlying architectures and properties are systematically evaluated. For each category, the development tactics and features of the algorithms with implementation examples are discussed by referring to their common signal processing flow graphically summarized in a chart and by highlighting their key issues tabulated for clear comparison. How to get started with building up an ML-based algorithm is subsequently presented. The specific properties of the ML-based algorithms are then discussed in terms of learning strategy, performance evaluation, experimental repeatability and reliability, data preparation, and data utilization strategy. This Guide is concluded by outlining strategies and considerations for prospect algorithms.},

  abstract = {Nanopore-based sensors have established themselves as a prominent tool for solution-based, single-molecule analysis of the key building blocks of life, including nucleic acids, proteins, glycans and a large pool of biomolecules that have an essential role in life and healthcare. The predominant molecular readout method is based on measuring the temporal fluctuations in the ionic current through the pore. Recent advances in materials science and surface chemistries have not only enabled more robust and sensitive devices but also facilitated alternative detection modalities based on field-effect transistors, quantum tunnelling and optical methods such as fluorescence and plasmonic sensing. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in nanopore fabrication and sensing strategies that endow nanopores not only with sensitivity but also with selectivity and high throughput, and highlight some of the challenges that still need to be addressed. Nanopore sensors enable the solution-based analysis of nucleic acids, proteins and other biomolecules at the single-molecule level.

  abstract = {Established methods for characterizing proteins typically require physical or chemical modification steps or cannot be used to examine individual molecules in solution. Ionic current measurements through electrolyte-filled nanopores can characterize single native proteins in an aqueous environment, but currently offer only limited capabilities. Here we show that the zeptolitre sensing volume of bilayer-coated solid-state nanopores can be used to determine the approximate shape, volume, charge, rotational diffusion coefficient and dipole moment of individual proteins. To do this, we developed a theory for the quantitative understanding of modulations in ionic current that arise from the rotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field inside the nanopore. The approach allows us to measure the five parameters simultaneously, and we show that they can be used to identify, characterize and quantify proteins and protein complexes with potential implications for structural biology, proteomics, biomarker detection and routine protein analysis. The zeptolitre sensing volume of bilayer-coated solid-state nanopores can be used to determine the approximate shape, volume, charge, rotational diffusion coefficient, and dipole moment of individual proteins.},

  abstract = {Nano-impact single-entity electrochemistry (NIE) is an emerging technique that enables electrochemical investigation of individual entities, ranging from metal nanoparticles to single cells and biomolecules. To extract meaningful information from NIE experiments, statistical analysis of large datasets is necessary. In this study, we developed a method for the automated analysis of NIE data based on unsupervised machine learning and template matching approaches. Template matching not only facilitates downstream processing of the NIE data but also provides a more accurate analysis of the NIE signal characteristics and variations that are difficult to discern with conventional data analysis techniques, such as the height threshold method. The developed algorithm enables fast automated processing of large experimental datasets recorded with different systems, requiring minimal human intervention and thereby eliminating human bias in data analysis. As a result, it improves the standardization of data processing and NIE signal interpretation across various experiments and applications.},
